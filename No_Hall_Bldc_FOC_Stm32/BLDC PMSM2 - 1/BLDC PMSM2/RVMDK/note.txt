When creating a new project for STM32F10x using RVMDK, you can accept to use the
STM32F10x.s startup file provided by RVMDK which is automatically copied into the
project by uVision (using RVMDK exception names). By default it will NOT work with
th STM32F10x Firmware Library.

To get it working you have to:
- Use pre-built (*.LIB) STM32F10x Firmware Library (Release or Debug version)
which is part of RVMDK, and there is no need to include the actual library C modules
or to use the configuration via stm32f10x_conf.h.
- Use interrupt template stm32f10x_it.c (No need for headers which are part of RVMDK)
- Use main module template (main.c)
